# Actor

Part of my Xcode projects and sources created during [Hacking With Swift Live](http://hackingwithswift.com/live) online-workshops hosted by [@twostraws](https://github.com/twostraws).

What is an actor and its purpose? 

Simple code examples in [ContentView.swift](Actor/ContentView.swift): 

- `URLCache`
- `BankAccount`
- `BasketballTeam` and `Player`
- Handling `Hashable` and `Codable` for actors
- when to use `nonisolated` and `isolated` keyword
- how global actors, the `MainActor` fit into the picture
