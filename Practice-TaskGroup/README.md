# Practice TaskGroup

Part of my Xcode projects and sources created during [Hacking With Swift Live](http://hackingwithswift.com/live) online-workshops hosted by [@twostraws](https://github.com/twostraws).

Writing an `loadData` method fetching data from different locations and of different types, combining the result before updating the views model.

No screenshot here... it's all in the code: [ContentView.swift](Practice-TaskGroup/ContentView.swift)!
