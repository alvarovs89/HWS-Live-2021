# Heterogenous TaskGroups

Part of my Xcode projects and sources created during [Hacking With Swift Live](http://hackingwithswift.com/live) online-workshops hosted by [@twostraws](https://github.com/twostraws).

Based on [Message Inbox](../Concurrency-Message-Inbox), where `TaskGroup` has been introduced, we tackle here the problem of using it to fetch different types of data.

Wrap the result in an `enum`!

No screenshot here... it's all in the code: [ContentView.swift](HeteroTaskGroups/ContentView.swift)!
